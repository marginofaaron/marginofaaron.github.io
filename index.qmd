Iâ€™m Aaron Olson, a data analyst based in Indianapolis, Indiana.

I primarily use this site to blog about data analysis. My data interests include geography, demographics, population statistics, and sports. This site was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [R Statistical Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/). R is my coding language of choice for statistical analysis and visualization, but I also use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) when the need arises.

*Disclaimer: Everything on this site comes from my own mind and is not associated with any employer or organization that I am currently or previously attached to :)*
