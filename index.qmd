Iâ€™m Aaron Olson, a data analyst based in Indianapolis, Indiana.

I primarily use this site to blog about data analysis. My data interests include geography, demographics, population statistics, and sports. This site was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [R Statistical Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/).
