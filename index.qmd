Hi, Iâ€™m Aaron ðŸ‘‹

My background is in data visualization and analytics and this website is my attempt at writing some code. It was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [R Statistical Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/).

I am self-taught with varying levels of proficiency in the following languages: R, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My areas of particular interest and expertise include U.S. Census data and population statistics. 

Let's build something [together](mailto:aaroneolson@pm.me).
