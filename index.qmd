#### 👋 About 

---

Hi! 

I’m Aaron, a data analyst and business intelligence team leader based in Indianapolis with a background in the [R Statistical Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/). This site is where I post about various data projects and document my experiences with writing code.

I am passionate about empowering data teams to maximize their potential through skill-building, knowledge sharing, and process improvement. My areas of subject-matter expertise include U.S. Census data and population statistics.  In my free time, I am also an avid sports fan and DIY carpentry hobbyist.

Send me an email if you want to [collaborate](mailto:aaroneolson@pm.me) or subscribe to receive updates on [my email list](https://marginofaaron.substack.com/).
