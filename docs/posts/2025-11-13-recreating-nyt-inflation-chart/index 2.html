<p>I have always liked the <em>Times’</em> graphics and think that this one is particularly clean. For years, they have been following a fairly consistent style guide making their data visualizations instantly recognizable.</p>
<p>I also know that <a href="https://github.com/mbostock">Mike Bostock</a> is formerly a member of that team and also the creator of the <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> and <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">Observable</a> JavaScript visualization libraries. I have been been learning both libraries recently and noticed that the <em>Times</em> style seems to have heavily influenced the Observable default styles.</p>
<p>So, I thought I would attempt to do two things using the Observable JS library:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, reproduce the NYT chart with the intention to match details of the original as closely as possible</li>
<li>Second, offer some potential improvements to the chart by adding interactive elements through</li>
</ol>

<p>Below is the final product, with the original NYT plot first and then my version–reproduced using Observable–next. Click on either image to expand.</p>

<p>With not-too-much effort, I would say I was successful in reproducing a nearly identical plot. I was able to do with without any special themes or templates. This is thanks to Observable’s simple syntax and default styles that look polished out of the box.</p>
<p>The next section details how I did this. Considering that I like to <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/elevate-your-code-with-vertical-coding-style/">format my code vertically</a> for improved readability, it still took less than 100 lines.</p>
<section id="how-i-did-this" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-did-this">How I did this</h3>
<p>First, I located data sets for <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL">Total CPI</a> and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL">CPI Minus Food and Energy</a> from FRED. After downloading the data, I combined both series into a single csv and went ahead and calculated the year-over-year percentage change for each. That is what the plot actually shows.</p>
<p>The dataset is then imported into R using the <code>readr</code> package. I start with R here rather than Observable since this is an <a href="https://quarto.org">R-based Quarto site</a> and I have found it to be the most straightforward workflow for importing data.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># load packages</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(readr)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># import inflation data</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>CPI_Sheet1 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">"assets/CPI - Sheet1.csv"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then, the data frame is passed through <code>ojs_define</code> to convert to a JavaScript array.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># convert R data frame to Observable JavaScript (ojs)</span></span>

</div>
<p>Once the data is in the JavaScript environment, I now switch to Observable code. The array needs to be transposed to be structured like a standard data frame and the <code>observation_date</code> field needs to be converted to JS date format using <code>new Date</code>.</p>

<span id="cb6-28"><a href="#cb6-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I have always liked the *Times'* graphics and think that this one is particularly clean. For years, they have been following a fairly consistent style guide making their data visualizations instantly recognizable.</span>
<span id="cb6-29"><a href="#cb6-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-30"><a href="#cb6-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I also know that <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Mike Bostock</span><span class="co">](https://github.com/mbostock)</span> is formerly a member of that team and also the creator of the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">D3</span><span class="co">](https://d3js.org)</span> and <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Observable</span><span class="co">](https://observablehq.com/plot/)</span> JavaScript visualization libraries. I have been been learning both libraries recently and noticed that the *Times* style seems to have heavily influenced the Observable default styles.</span>

<span id="cb6-32"><a href="#cb6-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>So, I thought I would attempt to do two things using the Observable JS library:</span>

<span id="cb6-34"><a href="#cb6-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">1.  </span>First, reproduce the NYT chart with the intention to match details of the original as closely as possible</span>
<span id="cb6-35"><a href="#cb6-35" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">2.  </span>Second, offer some potential improvements to the chart by adding interactive elements through</span>

<span id="cb6-47"><a href="#cb6-47" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With not-too-much effort, I would say I was successful in reproducing a nearly identical plot.

<span id="cb6-52"><a href="#cb6-52" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-53"><a href="#cb6-53" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>First, I located data sets for <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Total CPI</span><span class="co">](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL)</span> and <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">CPI Minus Food and Energy</span><span class="co">](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL)</span> from FRED. After downloading the data, I combined both series into a single csv and went ahead and calculated the year-over-year percentage change for each. That is what the plot actually shows.</span>
<span id="cb6-54"><a href="#cb6-54" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-55"><a href="#cb6-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The dataset is then imported into R using the <span class="in">`readr`</span> package. I start with R here rather than Observable since this is an <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">R-based Quarto site</span><span class="co">](https://quarto.org)</span> and I have found it to be the most straightforward workflow for importing data.</span>
