<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post shows the code for my analysis of Caitlin Clark’s historic 2024 WNBA season.</p>
<p>I calculated two metrics ‘point shares’ (the percentage of a team’s total points that a player accounts for) and ‘assist shares’ (the percentage of a team’s total assists that a player accounts for) to compare Clark to the last five seasons of both WNBA and NBA data.</p>
<p>The result are these cool scatterplots with NBA and WNBA players’ offensive production in relation to their teams’ output. Incredibly, Clark was the only WNBA or NBA player to account for 40% of their team’s assists and 20% of the team’s points in a season in the last five years.</p>

<span id="cb13-25"><a href="#cb13-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I calculated two metrics 'point shares' (the percentage of a team’s total points that a player accounts for) and 'assist shares' (the percentage of a team’s total assists that a player accounts for) to compare Clark to the last five seasons of both WNBA and NBA data.</span>
<span id="cb13-26"><a href="#cb13-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb13-27"><a href="#cb13-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The result are these cool scatterplots with NBA and WNBA players' offensive production in relation to their teams' output. Incredibly, Clark was the only WNBA or NBA player to account for 40% of their team's assists and 20% of the team's points in a season in the last five years.</span>
