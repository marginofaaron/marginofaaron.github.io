Hey there! üëã

Welcome to my blog. Special thanks to [Samantha Csik's wonderful guide](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) on setting up a blog on a Quarto website.

Don't worry, [I come in peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atUUjSLMSiM).

</br>

## üîé Viewing source code on this site

Data analyses in the blog posts on this site are usually conducted with the R coding language. To view the code that generates the analysis, click the **"\> Code"** dropdown button above each chunk.

There is also a button on the top right corner of every post with code-folding enabled to globally expand or collapse all code chunks.

### Code Chunk Example

For example, the code that loads the [iris](https://www.statology.org/iris-dataset-r/) dataset and generates the plot below can be expanded or collapsed by the **"\> Code"** dropdown button.

```{r}
#| label: iris-example
#| fig-cap: "A boxplot of the iris dataset"

boxplot(Sepal.Length~Species,
        data=iris,
        main='Sepal Length by Species',
        xlab='Species',
        ylab='Sepal Length',
        col='steelblue',
        border='black')


```

It's a [useful feature](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html) of Quarto that allows for documents to be consumed easily by both technical and non-technical readers.

Happy reading üòÅ
