# Introduction

This is an exploration of when population peaked in each county in the U.S. between 1920 and 2020.

Keep in mind that some county borders may have changed during this time period, so it's possible that some change in population is due to border change rather than change in the number of people within the same boundaries.

1920 was selected as a start year for two reasons. First, this allows us to view population change over the last century. Second, Most significant county border changes had been completed by 1920.

For more about how borders have changed over time, check out the [Atlas of County Historical Boundaries](https://digital.newberry.org/ahcb/index.html). Data was retrieved through the [National Historical Geographic Information System](https://www.nhgis.org/).

The code beow details the steps to produce this fascinating map. Enjoy!

## Import Data and View its Structure
```{r, results = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(mapview)
library(tigris)
library(sf)

```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# import data
county_pops_1900_2020 <- read_csv("Raw Data/county_pops_1900_2020.csv")

# view structure and check for NAs
summary(county_pops_1900_2020)

```

### Data Cleaning

There are 3,134 rows and all of the population columns are numeric. However, three nulls exist in the 'pop_2020' column; those should be investigated.

#### Check for duplicates

Luckily, there are no duplicate county GEOIDs, so no need for clean up there.

```{r}

# check if there are any duplicate GEOIDs
any(duplicated(county_pops_1900_2020$GEOID))

```

#### Dealing with Nulls

It looks like two Census Areas (county equivalents) in Alaska and one county in South Dakota have 'NaN' in the 2020 population column rather than values. These Alaska Census Areas were abolished between 2010 and 2020 and [replaced with other areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdez%E2%80%93Cordova_Census_Area,_Alaska), while Shannon County, SD was renamed as [Oglala Lakota County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Lakota_County,_South_Dakota).

They shouldn't cause too much of a problem, since we are only seeking the maximum population year for each county, but important to keep in mind when viewing the results.

```{r}
# show only rows with NAs in 'pop_2020' column
county_pops_1900_2020[is.na(county_pops_1900_2020$pop_2020), ]
```

#### Split the 'cty' field into 'county' and 'state'

This improves readability and allows for grouping by state and joining on Census region to the state later on

```{r}
# split the 'cty' field
county_pops_1900_2020[c('county', 'state')] <- str_split_fixed(county_pops_1900_2020$cty, ',', 2)

# view results
county_pops_1900_2020 %>% select(GEOID, cty, county, state) %>% head()

```

#### Remove 1900 and 1910 columns

Since we are only concerned with data from 1920 through 2020, these columns can be dropped

```{r}

# select only needed columns
county_pops_1920_2020 <- county_pops_1900_2020 %>%
  select (
    -pop_1900,
    -pop_1910
  )


```

## Analysis
Now that the cleaning is out of the way, let's find those max population years!

```{r}

# Find max of each county by reshaping data

long_county_pops_1920_2020 <- county_pops_1920_2020 %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !c(GEOID, cty, county, state),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "population"
  )

# Make a dataframe of the max population years

max_population_years <- long_county_pops_1920_2020 %>%
  group_by(cty) %>%
  slice_max(population, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  arrange(desc(population)) 

max_population_years

```

### Grouping by peak population year

It's not surprising that 2020 is the most common peak population year: the U.S. population has (generally) steadily increased over the past 100 years and so you'd expect 2020 to be the most common peak year. What is surprising is that 1920 is the second most common peak year behind 2020 with 454 counties peaking that year. In fact, 1920, 1930, and 1940 were the 2nd, 4th, and 5th most common peak population year.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Group by max population year and count
cty_by_max_yr <- max_population_years %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(number_of_counties = n())

# replace "pop_" for cleaner formatting
cty_by_max_yr$year <- str_replace_all(cty_by_max_yr$year, "pop_", "")

# make a bar chart of the result
cty_by_max_yr %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = number_of_counties)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = number_of_counties), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -0.5, color= "black", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "How many counties peaked each year?", 
       subtitle = "All U.S. Counties", 
       y = "N Counties", 
       x = "Peak Population Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1500)) +
  theme_ipsum()

```

### Regional Variation

To untangle why this is occuring, it's helpful to break the data down by region. Here, I join on [Census region and division definitions](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Import census regions and divisions sheet
census_regions <- read_csv("Raw Data/census_regions.csv")

# Trim whitespace from max_population_years to facilitate merging
max_population_years$state <- trimws(max_population_years$state)

# Join regions and divisions to max_population_years
max_population_years <- merge(x = max_population_years, 
                              y = census_regions,
                              by.x = "state",
                              by.y = "State")

```

There are significant differences between regions in the distribution of peak population years. The Midwest really stands out here. In the Midwest, 35% of counties had a peak population year in 1920 or 1930. That's compared to 18% of Southern counties, 12% of Western counties, and just 5% of Northeastern counties.

The West also stands out, but for the opposite reason. Over 60% of counties in the West reached their peak population year in 2020. That's compared to just 28% of Midwestern counties.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Group by Region and max year
region_cty_by_max_yr <- max_population_years %>%
  group_by(Region, year) %>%
  summarise(number_of_counties = n())

# replace "pop_" for cleaner formatting
region_cty_by_max_yr$year <- str_replace_all(region_cty_by_max_yr$year, "pop_", "")

# Calculate percentage
region_cty_by_max_yr <- region_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  mutate(percentage = number_of_counties / sum(number_of_counties))

# Faceted bar chart by Region
region_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = Region)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  #geom_text(aes(label = number_of_counties), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -0.5, color= "black", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "What % of Counties Peaked Each Year?", 
       subtitle = "All U.S. Counties - by Region", 
       y = "Percentage", 
       x = "Peak Population Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  #theme_ipsum() +
  facet_wrap(~ Region, nrow = 2)


```

There is also significant variation in peak population years *within* the Midwest itself. The Midwest region is broken down into the West North Central (Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri) and East North Central (Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio) divisions. Half of the counties in the West North Central division peaked in either 1920 or 1930.

Keep in mind that it's possible some counties peaked *before* 1920, but our data frame is restricted to the last 100 years only.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Group by Division (Midwest Only) and max year
mw_cty_by_max_yr <- max_population_years %>%
  filter(Region == "Midwest") %>%
  group_by(Division, year) %>%
  summarise(number_of_counties = n())

# replace "pop_" for cleaner formatting
mw_cty_by_max_yr$year <- str_replace_all(mw_cty_by_max_yr$year, "pop_", "")

# Calculate percentage
mw_cty_by_max_yr <- mw_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  group_by(Division) %>%
  mutate(percentage = number_of_counties / sum(number_of_counties))

# Faceted bar chart by Region
mw_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = Division)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  #geom_text(aes(label = number_of_counties), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -0.5, color= "black", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "What % of Counties Peaked Each Year?", 
       subtitle = "Midwest Counties - by Division", 
       y = "Percentage", 
       x = "Peak Population Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  #theme_ipsum() +
  facet_wrap(~ Division, nrow = 1)

```

### Do any states stand out?

Although not a state, I did not know that Washington, D.C.'s population peaked in 1950. Beyond that, those "West North Central" Midwestern states have a comparatively high percentage of counties peaking in 1930 and 1920. In North Dakota, 43% of counties peaked in 1930.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Group by state and max year
state_cty_by_max_yr <- max_population_years %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarise(number_of_counties = n())

# replace "pop_" for cleaner formatting
state_cty_by_max_yr$year <- str_replace_all(state_cty_by_max_yr$year, "pop_", "")

# Calculate percentage
state_cty_by_max_yr <- state_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(percentage = number_of_counties / sum(number_of_counties))

# Show states with high percent of counties peaking before 2020
state_cty_by_max_yr %>%
  filter(
    year != '2020'
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(percentage))



```

### Final County Map

Check out the map below. What interesting trends do you see?
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# get county geographies
county_geo <- tigris::counties(cb = TRUE, resolution = '20m')
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# join county geographies to peak population year data
static_map_data <- merge(x = county_geo,
                         y = max_population_years,
                         by = "GEOID")

# remove Alaska/Hawaii for cleaner mapping
static_map_data <- static_map_data %>%
  filter(!(state %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii")))

# replace "pop_" in peak year column and change to numeric
static_map_data$year <- str_replace_all(static_map_data$year, "pop_", "")

static_map_data$year <- as.numeric(static_map_data$year)

# Make a map
ggplot(data = static_map_data, aes(fill = year)) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  labs(title = "  Peak Population Years of U.S. Counties",
       subtitle = "   between 1920 and 2020",
       caption = "Source: NHGIS",
       fill = "Peak Year  ") + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_continuous(type = "viridis",
                        breaks = c(1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000, 2020))
