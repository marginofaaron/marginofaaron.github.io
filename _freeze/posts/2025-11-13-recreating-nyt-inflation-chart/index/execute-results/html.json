For years, they have been following a fairly consistent style guide making their data visualizations instantly recognizable.\n\nI also know that [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) is formerly a member of that team and also the creator of the [D3](https://d3js.org) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/plot/) JavaScript visualization libraries. I have been been learning both libraries recently and noticed that the *Times* style seems to have heavily influenced the Observable default styles.\n\nSo, I thought I would attempt to do two things using the Observable JS library:\n\n1.  First, reproduce the NYT chart with the intention to match details of the original as closely as possible\n2.  Second, offer some potential improvements to the chart by adding interactive elements through\n\n## Reproducing the Chart Using Observable\n\nBelow is the final product, with the original NYT plot first and then my version--reproduced using Observable--next. Click on either image to expand.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![NYT Chart](assets/nyt_original.png)\n\n![My Chart](assets/nyt_me.png)\n:::\n\nWith not-too-much effort, I would say I was successful in reproducing a nearly identical plot. I was able to do this with without any special themes or templates. This is thanks to Observable's simple syntax and default styles that look polished out of the box.\n\nThe next section details how I did this. Considering that I like to [format my code vertically](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/elevate-your-code-with-vertical-coding-style/) for improved readability, it still took less than 100 lines.\n\n### How I did this\n\nFirst, I located data sets for [Total CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL) and [CPI Minus Food and Energy](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL) from FRED. After downloading the data, I combined both series into a single csv and went ahead and calculated the year-over-year percentage change for each. That is what the plot actually shows.\n\nThe dataset is then imported into R using the `readr` package. I start with R here rather than Observable since this is an [R-based Quarto site](https://quarto.org) and I have found it to be the most straightforward workflow for importing data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# import inflation data\nCPI_Sheet1 <- read_csv(\"assets/CPI - Sheet1.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, the data frame is passed through `ojs_define` to convert to a JavaScript array.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# convert R data frame to Observable JavaScript (ojs)\nCPI_Sheet1 = ojs_define(CPI_Sheet1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce the data is in the JavaScript environment, I now switch to Observable code. The array needs to be transposed to be structured like a standard data frame and the `observation_date` field needs to be converted to JS date format using `new Date`.\n\n```{ojs}\n\n// transpose array to use with javascript\nCPI = transpose(CPI_Sheet1)\n\n\n// convert observation_date to date format\nCPI1 = CPI.map(d => ({...d, \n               ob_date: new Date(d.observation_date)}\n               ))\n\n```\n\nNow, the fun part. Notice that the NYT plot has a dot denoting the last inflation observation in September 2025. In order to plot that dot, I need a separate array with a single object containing the coordinates for that dot.\n\nThis code extracts the last object in the data array using `slice`, defines an empty array, and then uses `push` to add that object to the array. This array can now be used in the later plot code.\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\n\n// get last object\ndot = CPI1.slice(-1)[0]\n\n// define empty array\nlastDot = []\n\n// push last object onto the array\nlastDot.push(dot)\n\n```\n\nThe plot itself consists of two `Plot.lineY` calls, one for each line. I used a color picker tool in my browser to get hex code approximations for the line `stroke` colors. Then, three `Plot.text` calls for the \"Inflation\" label and the two annotations for the final observation.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, `Plot.dot` was used with the `lastDot` array I defined to highlight the final observation as well. `Plot.arrow` made a simple curved arrow using custom-defined `x` and `y` coordinates for the start and end points--pretty simple!\n\nFinally, `Plot.axisX` and `Plot.axisY` made quick work of mimicking the axes, including some `d3` formatting calls to transform raw values into percents and years. `Plot.gridY` with a `strokeDasharray` argument set the dotted horizontal grid lines in the background.\n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\n\n// make the plot\nPlot.plot({ \n  // set area around plot\n  marginBottom: 60,\n  marginLeft: 50,\n  marginRight: 100,\n  \n  // set default styles and axis limits\n  style: {fontSize: 14},\n  y: {domain: [-0.02,.10]},\n  x: {domain: [new Date(\"2005-01-01\"), new Date(\"2025-10-30\")]},\n  caption: \"Year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index.

This section details how I made a new interactive version of the NYT inflation chart as shown below. Adjust the date range of the data using the dropdown inputs and hover over the plot to reveal values for each observation.\n\n</br>\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\n\n// set a starting date for the range\nviewof startDate = Inputs.date({label: \"Start Date\", \n                                value: \"2005-01-01\",\n                                min: minDate,\n                                max: maxDate,\n                                required: true})\n\n// set an end date for the range\nviewof endDate = Inputs.date({label: \"End Date\", \n                              value: \"2025-09-01\",\n                             min: '1948-01-01',\n                             max: maxDate,\n                             required: true})\n\n```\n\n</br>\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\n\n// make the plot\nPlot.plot({\n  marginBottom: 60,\n  marginLeft: 50,\n  marginRight: 20,\n  style: {fontSize: 14},\n  \n  y: {domain: [minYBound, maxYBound]},\n  x: {domain: [startDate, endDate]},\n  caption: \"Year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index.

The `min` and `max` of the date input set the allowable dates than can be submitted. `startDate` has a `min` set to the oldest date in the dataset (defined later as `minDate`) and a `max` set to the newest date in the dataset (also defined later).\n\n`endDate` has the same max, but I set the minimum to one year greater than the oldest date in the dataset because I couldn't think of a reason why you would need to view a range less than 1 year. \n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\n\n// set a starting date for the range\nviewof startDate = Inputs.date({label: \"Start Date\", \n                                value: \"2005-01-01\",\n                                min: minDate,\n                                max: maxDate,\n                                required: true})\n\n// set an end date for the range\nviewof endDate = Inputs.date({label: \"End Date\", \n                              value: \"2025-09-01\",\n                             min: '1948-01-01',\n                             max: maxDate,\n                             required: true})\n\n```\n\nAs mentioned before, these simple variable assignments pull out all of the dates in the `CPI1` dataset and then set the oldest date to `minDate` and the newest date to `maxDate`.\n\n```{ojs}\n\n// pull out dates\ndates = CPI1.map(d => d.ob_date)\n\n// get minimum date\nminDate = new Date(Math.min(...dates))\n\n// get maximum date\nmaxDate = new Date(Math.max(...dates))\n\n```\n\nOur original data set is filtered based on the result of the `startDate` and `endDate` inputs. Because of the default values set earlier, this means that the data set is initially restricted to '2005-01-01' and '2025-09-01'.\n\n```{ojs}\n\n// filter the array based on the start date and end date inputs\ncpiSheet1Filt = CPI1.filter(d => d.ob_date >= startDate && d.ob_date <= endDate)\n\n```\n\nThe interactive plot is built with two `Plot.lineX` calls, just like the static plot earlier. However, this time the data being plotted is `cpiSheet1Filt`, which we just described above.\n\nThe two date range inputs also define the `x` domain--this sets the viewable x-axis on the plot. Because the x-axis can vary widely (date ranges from 1947 through 2025), I needed to set dynamic tick mark intervals. If this wasn't done, then when the data is \"zoomed out\" the initial tick mark interval of 5 years will show overlapping tick marks and it will look cluttered. `dynamicTick()` is an if-else statement defined later that sets the tick mark intervals at various cut points depending on how many years are visible.\n\nThe `y` domain is also dynamic based on the `minYBound` and `maxYBound` variables (defined later). This is necessary because some time frames ('70s and '80s) had much higher inflation than others ('90s). Hard-coding a domain to fit all of the values would cause the plotted lines to look very small in year ranges where inflation was low.\n\nInteractive hover effects are achieved through three separate `Plot.pointerX` calls--two wrapped in a `dot` call and another wrapped in a `ruleX` call. The dots are anchored to each line series, following each line's observations as the user moves along the x axis. Simultaneously, the vertical line (`ruleX`) tracks with the user's mouse to visually line up with the x axis dates.\n\nFinally, another `Plot.pointerX` call wrapped in a `Plot.text` call is anchored to the top-left of the plot to print out the date, total inflation, and inflation without food and energy series observations that the user's mouse is hovering over. This particular implementation might look overwhelming at first, but I used the example on the [fantastic Observable documentation](https://observablehq.com/plot/interactions/pointer) as a base, and then modified for my needs. \n\n```{ojs}\n//| eval: false\n\n// make the plot\nPlot.plot({\n  marginBottom: 60,\n  marginLeft: 50,\n  marginRight: 20,\n  style: {fontSize: 14},\n  \n// dynamic axis ranges\n  y: {domain: [minYBound, maxYBound]},\n  x: {domain: [startDate, endDate]},\n  caption: \"Year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index.

Additionally, the `dynamicTick` function lays out a series of `if-else` statements based on the `yearRange` variable, which simply calculates the number of years visible in the filtered dataset we defined earlier. The output of this function provides the tick mark intervals of the plot.\n\n```{ojs}\n\n// find the maximum inflation value in the filtered array\nmaxValue = Math.max(\n  //...cpiSheet1Filt.map(d => d.yoyCPILFESL),\n  ...cpiSheet1Filt.map(d => d.yoyCPIAUCSL)\n)\n\n// find the minimum inflation value in the filtered array\nminValue = Math.min(\n  //...cpiSheet1Filt.map(d => d.yoyCPILFESL),\n  ...cpiSheet1Filt.map(d => d.yoyCPIAUCSL)\n)\n\n// create variable for max y limit\nmaxYBound = Math.round((maxValue + .01) * 100) / 100\n\n// create variable for min y limit\nminYBound = Math.round((minValue - .01) * 100) / 100\n\n// set tick marks based on date range\nyearRange =  endDate.getUTCFullYear() - startDate.getUTCFullYear()\n\ndynamicTick = () => {\n  if (yearRange >= 20 && yearRange <= 50) {\n    return \"5 years\";\n  }\n  else if (yearRange > 50) {\n    return \"10 years\";\n  }\n  else if (yearRange >= 10 && yearRange < 20) {\n    return \"2 years\";\n  }\n  else if (yearRange > 2 && yearRange < 10) {\n    return \"year\";\n  }\n  else if (yearRange <= 2 && yearRange > 0) {\n    return \"3 months\";\n  }\n  else {\n    return \"month\";\n}\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn short, Observable rocks :)",
